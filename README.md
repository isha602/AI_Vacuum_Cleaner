# AI_Vacuum_Cleaner
A simple vacuum cleaner problem in AI that acts as a goal based agent. 


The environment is a 8x8 maze surrounding by walls.
Each cell is a room.
We have two rooms i.e A and B 
The walls are always clean.
The agent cannot pass through the wall.
The agent can go north, south, east, and west. 

There is dirt in both the rooms and it is to be cleaned. 
The vacuum cleaner is present in any one of these rooms. So, we have to reach a state in which both the rooms are clean and are dust free.
